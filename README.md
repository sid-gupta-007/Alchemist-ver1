A real-time gesture-controlled Dr. Strange–style alchemy circle VFX system built with OpenCV, MediaPipe Hands, and Python. This project detects hand gestures via webcam and renders dynamic, animated magical circles, runes, and mandala-style glyphs—similar to the visuals from Marvel's Doctor Strange and Iron Man’s holograms..
