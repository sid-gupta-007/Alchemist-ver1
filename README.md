# Alchemist-Version 1
A real-time gesture-controlled Dr. Strange–style alchemy circle VFX system built with OpenCV, MediaPipe Hands, and Python. This project detects hand gestures via webcam and renders dynamic, animated magical circles, runes, and mandala-style glyphs—similar to the visuals from Marvel's Doctor Strange and Iron Man’s holograms..

✨ **Features:**

⦁	🔮 Gesture Recognition

⦁	Powered by MediaPipe Hand tracking:

⦁	Pinch gesture (Thumb + Index) → Spawn alchemy circle

⦁	Fist gesture → Dismiss circle

⦁	Open Palm → Auto-spawn circle

⦁	Depth-based scaling → Circle automatically changes size as your hand moves closer/farther from the camera


🌀 **Dynamic Magical Effects:**

⦁	Randomized styles each time you spawn

⦁	Mandala layers

⦁	Rotating polygons

⦁	Radial energy beams

⦁	Animated runes

⦁	Multiple color themes (gold, magenta, cyan)

⦁	Supports two hands independently

🔥 **Smooth Animations:**

⦁	Soft transitions

⦁	Angle-based rotations

⦁	Glow overlays using alpha blending

⦁	Magical arc segments that grow over time
